;; Procedure:
;;   right-section
;; Parameters:
;;   proc, a binary procedure
;;   right, a value
;; Purpose:
;;   to create a function that runs proc with fixed right value
;; Preconditions:
;;   proc must be a function that takes two parameters
;;   right must be a valid value for proc's right parameter
;; Postconditions:
;;   returns a function that runs proc with the given right value

;; Postconditions:
;;   returns an integer that is the dot product

;; Purpose:
;;   to create a list of numbers up to a point

;; Preconditions:
;;   coeffs must be a list of real numbers starting with the coefficient for x^0
;;   all the way up to x^n, where n is the list length - 1
;; Postconditions:
